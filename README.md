# Garbage Classification

This repository contains garbage classification models built using PyTorch, capable of accurately classifying garbage into different categories. It includes two versions of the model, one with 6 classes & the other with 12 classes, to cater to different needs.

## Models

There are two models currently available:

1. **Baseline Model**: This model has 6 classes and was trained on 3,500 images. It has an average accuracy of 93.5%. This model is located in the main branch.

2. **Advanced Model**: This advanced model has 12 classes and was trained on 15,515 images. It has a maximum accuracy of 97.6% and is located in the "extra" folder under the "testbr" branch.
